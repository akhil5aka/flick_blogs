While so many abandoned blogging for the simplicity of social media, a heap of people are still committed to this self-defined, flexible and algorithm-free form of journalling. In fact, it looks to me like there’s a resurgence of blogging as people seek out alternatives to being at the mercy of the social media bully boys. And why wouldn’t they? Social media is super convenient and lots of fun, but it’s also governed by a gang of democracy-crushing, money-hoarding, self-obsessed narcissists. It makes sense to seek out an alternative.

Thankfully there are a LOT of alternatives, because so many people are blogging and sharing brilliant stories, recipes, insights and photography. I find the best way to enjoy this good stuff is to create an account in FEEDLY and then add all these blogs to your reading list. Then all you do is log in to Feedly whenever you fancy some inspiration and the blogs that have updated will show themselves. Next you grab a coffee and a cookie/biscuit and settle in for a cosy read!
