part from that? My eldest is having a baby! I’m so excited to be Granny Pip, I can’t even begin to describe it. We have had so many losses in our family, it is very bolstering to at last have a very special baby-shaped gain. The wee darling is coming next year, a couple of weeks after my birthday if Baby feels that’s the right thing. Can you even believe it, pals?! I bought this book for Rin to celebrate.
